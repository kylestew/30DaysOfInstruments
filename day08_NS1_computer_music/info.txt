Day 08: NS1 Computer Music

The classic computer noise from all those old movies… now on your synth!
This patch uses the sample & hold module to vary the notes played and the cutoff frequency of the LFO.

Patch Details:
- LFO1 triangle wave out to sample & hold input
- LFO2 rect wave out to sample & hold trigger
- Output of sample & hold controls VCO pitch via V/oct input
- Output of sample & hold also controls CV input of LFO to vary the cutoff frequency randomly
- LFO2 rect wave also triggers ADSR gate in sync with note changes

Learned:
How useful the sample & hold module can be. I wish there was another one on this synth so I can feed in/out other signals. I’ve got something in the works that might help with that.
