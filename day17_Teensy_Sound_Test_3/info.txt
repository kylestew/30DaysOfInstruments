Day 17: Teensy Sessions - Teensy MIDI Slave II

Continuing yesterdays session to see how much sound I can get out of the Teensy. It took a long play session before I started getting something approaching music.

Details:
(see yesterday for setup)

Learned:
Scale and key changes can help make a repetitive sequence a little more interesting. This is the last session I will be doing with the Teensy this month but Iâ€™m amazed how much audio power this $20 board has.
