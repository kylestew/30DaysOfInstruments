Day 25: Pure Data Sessions 07

This started out as an experiment with wave folding and ended up in drone city! I spent over an hour playing with different adjustments to see what kind of soundscape I could create.

Details:
- Dual oscillators feeding into dual wave fold modules
- Wave fold amount slowly adjusts via an LFO which can be cranked up using a slider input
- Both OSC/Wavefold combinations are filtered to pull out the harsh high end tones wave folding creates
- The second lower pitched oscillator runs through a ladder filter / reverb combo to give the drone its main voice

Learned:
Wave folding needs to be filtered or band limited in some way otherwise there are some pretty harsh artifacts.
