Day 24: Pure Data Sessions 06

Playing with Wavetable synthesis in PD. Adding more channels to the mixer can really increase the use of existing modules. I really feel like the kick drum added a ton to this patch even though it was the simplest piece.

Details:
- Two wavetables oscillators driven with the same X/Y/Z inputs but at a different pitch
- Each wavetable OSC is given a random base pitch over time due to clock changes and the use of probability and random voltage modules
- Second wavetable goes through a granular delay creating the background drone texture
- 3 LFOs are slowly sweeping the wavetables inputs

Learned:
The wavetable oscillator contains 18 wavetables that you can scan, morph and crossfade. I’m not sure exactly what that means but that’s what we are hearing and I think it sounds pretty neat!
