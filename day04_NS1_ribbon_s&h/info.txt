Day 04: NS1 Ribbon + Sample & Hold

Finally got this toy in the mail and have been having a lot of fun setting up different patches. It’s small but the #NS1nanosynth includes a lot of features and extensibility. This patch uses the ribbon controller to control pitch and the sample and hold module to adjust the filter cutoff on a beat.

Patch Details:
- Saw wave —> Lowpass Filter —> VCA
- LFO —> ADSR —> VCA CV
- Ribbon Hold —> VCO 1v/octave CV
- LFO —> Lowpass Filter CV

Learned:
It’s been great to finally get hands on experience with the basic components of a synth. All my experience thus far has pretty much just been in MaxMSP. Now I get to move around wires and hear the output in realtime. This is also the first time I’ve incorporated the sample and hold module into a patch.
