Day 28: Pure Data Sessions 10

Karplus Khaos
Adapted an example from the creator of Automatonism. Sounds like an insane orchestra.
Original patch had a much more chaotic clock system based on looping output of 3 LFOs, pretty insane.

Details:
- Karplus —> Reverb module driven by 8 step sequencer
- Strings are triggered through a probability module so they don’t hit on every beat
- To add to the chaos, contour and color are adjusted over time by LFOs
- Varied pitch and other params on the kick drum to keep it from getting too repetitive

Learned:
I’ve gained a pretty good understanding of the building blocks for sound design but am really struggling to turn noise into music. There is a large difference between knowing the tool and creating art with them.
