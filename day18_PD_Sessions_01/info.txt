Day 18: Pure Data Sessions 01

Gearing up to create some instruments on hardware and its looking like Pure Data is a great way to go. So it’s time to finally learn how to use it. Luckily I came across Automatonism (https://www.automatonism.com/), which is a bunch of pre-made modular synth abstractions for PD. It’s like an easier to use version of Beap.

Details:
- Pulse wave OSC —> Lowpass Filter —> VCA —> DAC
- AHR envelope generator controls LPF cutoff
- Another AHR envelope generator controls CV of VCA for distinct notes
- LFO driving pulse width modulation on main OSC

Learned:
I miss MaxMSP already, it’s just so much easier to use and provides a ton of options. That being said, PD can do everything that Max does with the right extensions and custom programming. Time to get to work!
