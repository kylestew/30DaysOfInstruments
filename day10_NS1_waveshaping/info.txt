Day 10: NS1 Brutal Waveshaping

The NS1 comes with multiple basic oscillators but thatâ€™s just the beginning of the waveforms you can create with it. By combining the sum/sub module and oscillator sync, very interesting waveforms can be created. I bet there are many more waveforms hidden in this synth!

Patch Details:
- Waves combined in the sum/sub module: Sub oscillator(+) / Saw wave(-)
- LFO2 input as oscillator sync and turned up to audio range - this makes the output snap to notes
- Ribbon cable as v/oct CV input to oscillator makes this synth patch playable

Learned:
The sum/sub module allows for the combination of waves without going out of the 0-5v audio signal range in this synth. Although if you hit that limit distortion occurs, which can be used to your advantage. It takes a bit to wrap you head around the math, but its easy enough to just try different combinations and listen to the resulting wave.
