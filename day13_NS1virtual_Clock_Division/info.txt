Day 13: NS1virtual Clock Division

Designing this one virtually before grabbing the patch cables and my NS1. This is a patch inspired by the creator of the NS1 that uses the clock divider in multiple clever ways at once. It took a bit of thinking and research to figure out how to virtually simulate the clock divider. Its a pretty useful tool for making your synth build its own musical sequences.

Patch Details:
- LFO1 is samples for not frequencies on VCO
- VCO sends the SQR and SAW waves to the SUM/SUB module for some extra crispy sounds
- LFO2 drives the main clock signal
- The clock divider is used liberally to control the ADSR, VCA, and VCF
- Logic modules help combine and send the output to the above modules

Learned:
Iâ€™m just getting started with the possibilities of the clock divider. Its interesting how quickly it turns a single beat into a whole sequence of activity.
