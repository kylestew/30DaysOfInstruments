Day 19: Pure Data Sessions 02

First time synthesizing drums, not to far off my own TB-303!

Details:
- Main clock drives 2 16 beat sequencers
- Main clock divided by 16 and again by 2 and 4, outputs of clock dividers change sequencer banks
- Sequencer 1 drives a kick drum simulator
- Sequencer 2 drives a snare drum simulator
- Kick and Snare settings are adjusted live with the nanoKontrol inputs

Learned:
Drums are a whole different lesson in synthesis. From a physics perspective, drums are seriously hard to simulate. Whereas a string is 2 dimensional, the drum head is 3D and introduces all sorts of vibrational complexity. These synthesized drums might not sound very close to the real thing but they have a unique and interesting sound all their own.
