Day 21: Pure Data Sessions 03

Sequencing the sequencer (and other new things learned)

Details:
- Dual bandwidth limited oscillators for that smoother sound
- OSC —> Mixer —-> Lowpass Filter
- AHR envelope drives the VCA and a bit of the LPF cutoff frequency
- Main clock drives sequencer
- Clock is divided by 16 and again by 4 which is fed into random voltages modules and then quantized to a note
- Two notes combined to give the sequence a base note change every 4 measures

Learned:
Continuing to expand on composition instead of noise, hopefully towards making music instead of just sound. Quantization of notes really helps in this process. I also learned that bandwidth limited oscillators aren’t standard in PD like they are in MSP.
